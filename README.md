# Fractal_Tree
Fractal_Tree is a python program that uses the turtle module to draw a fractal tree. A fractal tree is a recursive structure that consists of a main branch and two smaller branches at an angle from the main branch. The smaller branches are then repeated recursively until a certain depth is reached.

## Installation
To run Fractal_Tree, you need to have python 3 installed on your system. You can download python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/. You also need to have the turtle module, which is a standard library module in python 3. You can check if you have the turtle module by typing `import turtle` in the python shell. If no error occurs, you have the turtle module.

## Usage
To run Fractal_Tree, you can either use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm, VS Code, or Thonny, or you can use the command line. To use the command line, navigate to the folder where you have saved the Fractal_Tree.py file and type `python Fractal_Tree.py`. This will open a new window where you will see the fractal tree being drawn.

You can modify some parameters in the Fractal_Tree.py file to change the appearance of the fractal tree.

You can change parameters by editing the values in the Fractal_Tree.py file and saving it before running it again.

## Example
Here is an example of a fractal tree drawn with the default parameters:
